# Identification-of-Human-Motion-Primitive-Activities-using-Accelerometer-Readings
In this project, I looked at an approach to identify the Human Motion Primitive activities by extracting various features by observing the different patterns of the accelerometer data collected for each activity while performing. I have built lots of classifier models out of which the SVM model which built in python is the best model resulted in accurately predicting the correct HMP activity 92.91% of the times as compared to a random choice of 14.47% which can be considered significant. If I integrate this model to a wrist watch then doctors can monitor the results for treating the Alzheimer patients and elderly people, and people with some type of impairment.
